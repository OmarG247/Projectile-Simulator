# Projectile-Simulator
A realistic projectile simulator made in Turing as a personal project.

#To run it
To access it simply run the 'Kinematics Project V8.exe'.

#To access the source code
Download and install a version of Turing from http://compsci.ca/holtsoft/ OR a version of Open Turing from http://tristan.hume.ca/openturing/ and access any of the 'Kinematics Project Vx.t' files.

#How it works
It was made on with basic functions that use gravitational and kinematic equations as well as simple loops and sprites.

#Challenges I ran into
Surprisingly, the biggest challenge I ran into was not obtaining the data to plot, instead, it was coming up with the most appropriate scale and the ratio of pixels/metres.

#Why I made it
I was inspired to make this as a fun project by my friends in high school who were taking physics at the time, as well by the current grade 12 physics teacher who I knew from the Earth & Space science class. (I added his face as a projectile that can be launched lol).
